# CodeAlpha_Car-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning-
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the market price of used cars based on features like brand, age, fuel type, transmission, and mileage. Multiple regression models were trained and evaluated to understand which factors most impact car pricing.
